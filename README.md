# planetary-blockchain
Planetary blockachain, is for exchanging IPFS files between users.
For example the people can exchange paper money represented in json or 
they can exchange directories with information about the product.

There are two types of blockchain that can be created.
The Single Planetary-Blockchain means a single key can own many files.
The One-to-One Planetary-Blockchain means that one key can only own one file.
The reason behind one-to-one, is to hide the transactions that one user does from a public blockchain.

The Planetary-Blockchain uses the IPFS and the Tendermint to accomplish its objective.
It is in a prototype state.
